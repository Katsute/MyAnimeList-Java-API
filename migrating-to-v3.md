# Migrating to v3

Version 3 includes several breaking changes which are documented below.

## üìã Types of Breaking Changes

 - **üÜï New:** A new addition to the library, class, method, or field.
 - **‚õî Breaking Change:** A major change to the library, class, method, or field.
 - **‚ö†Ô∏è Changed:** A minor behavioral change to a class or method.
 - **‚ùå Removed:** A class, method, or field that has been removed.

## üìã Changes

### ‚õî Package changed from `com.kttdevelopment.mal4j` to `dev.katsute.mal4j`

As part of the v3 migration, this package's group ID has been changed from `com.kttdevelopment` to `dev.katsute`. All future versions will be released under this new group ID; v2 will still use the old group ID.

When upgrading to v3 the dependency group ID must be changed in the dependencies section:

```diff
...
<dependency>
--  <groupId>com.kttdevelopment</groupId>
++  <groupId>dev.katsute</groupId>
    <artifactId>mal4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
...
```

Along with the group ID, any imports referencing to this library must also be updated. The easiest way to migrate from v2 to v3 is to replace all `import com.kttdevelopment.mal4j.` with `import dev.katsute.mal4j.`.

If you are using modules you must change `requires com.kttdevelopment.mal4j` to `requires dev.katsute.mal4j`.

### ‚ùå Removed deprecated authentication methods from `MyAnimeList`

The following authentication methods have been been deprecated since v2.7.0 in favor of clearer method names.

 - `withOAuthToken` is now `withToken`.
 - `refreshOAuthToken` is now `refreshToken`.
 - `withAuthorization` is now `withOAuth2`.

### ‚ùå Removed String parameters from `MyAnimeListAuthenticator`

The old constructor has been marked as deprecated since v2.7.0 due to poor reusability with access tokens in favor of a new `Authorization` object as a parameter.

Previously:

```java
new MyAnimeListAuthenticator("client_id", "client_secret", "authorization_code", "PKCE_code_challenge");
```

Should be replaced with:

```java
new MyAnimeListAuthenticator(new Authorization("client_id", "client_secret", "authorization_code", "PKCE_code_challenge"));
```

If you were not already using this new object before, an access token can be passed to this method to use an existing token, rather than generating a new one:

```java
new MyAnimeListAuthenticator(new Authorization(...), new AccessToken("access_token");
new MyAnimeListAuthenticator(new Authorization(...), new AccessToken("access_token", "refresh_token");
new MyAnimeListAuthenticator(new Authorization(...), new AccessToken("access_token", "refresh_token", 1640995200);
```

### ‚ùå Removed `getMyself` from `MyAnimeList`

The `getMyself` method has been deprecated since v2.2.0 in favor of a more formal name `getAuthenticatedUser`. The old method has now been removed.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Using experimental features without explicitly enabling them will now throw an exception

Previously using an experimental feature without enabling it would only print a warning, now using an experimental feature without enabling it will throw a `DisabledFeatureException` exception.

To enable an experimental feature use `MyAnimeList.enableExperimentalFeature`.

## &nbsp;

### ‚õî Moved exceptions from `mal4j` to `mal4j.exceptions`

All exceptions have been moved from the base package to a new `exceptions` package.

Any exception from this package must have its import updated manually.

### ‚ùå Removed `AndroidCompatibilityException`

The `AndroidCompatibilityException` has been deprecated since v2.4.0 and is now removed.

## &nbsp;

### ‚õî `Anime`, `AnimeListStatus`, `Manga`, and `MangaListStatus` now return `NullableDate` for the `getStartDate`, `getEndDate` and `getFinishDate` methods

MyAnimeList does not always have a complete date for a Anime or Manga listing, as a consequence of using the `Date` object any listing that was missing a month or day would automatically resolve to January 1st when it should be null.

These methods now return a `NullableDate` such that:

```
NullableDate{
    getYear(): int | null
    getMonth(): Month | null
    getMonthNum(): int | null
    getDay(): int | null
}
```

Listings with a missing month or day now return null instead of Janurary 1st.

## &nbsp;

### ‚ùå Removed `Digital_Manga` and `Web_Manga` from `AnimeSource`

The `Digital_Manga` and `Web_Manga` enums have been deprecated since v2.8.0 in favor of `DigitalManga` and `WebManga` enums. The old underscored enums have now been removed.

## &nbsp;

### ‚ùå Removed `Novel` from `MangaType`

The `Novel` enum has been deprecated since v1.1.0 due to a bug and `LightNovel` was added as a replacement. This enum has been removed.
